## About the Book

"The Vagus Advantage" bridges cutting-edge neuroscience and everyday wellness, offering insights into the remarkable potential of vagus nerve stimulation. It is designed for:

- **Healthcare professionals** seeking additional tools for patient care.
- **Researchers** exploring the intersection of neuroscience and wellness technology.
- **Individuals** looking to take an active role in managing their mental and physical wellbeing.

## Repository Structure

- **Quarto Files**: The main content of the book is written in `.qmd` files, located in the root directory.
- **Resources**: Supplementary files such as images, bibliographies, and stylesheets are located in the `_resources/` folder.
- **Generated Files**: The `docs/` folder contains the rendered HTML outputs of the book.

## How to Build the Book

To build the book locally, you will need [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) installed on your system. Once installed, run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
quarto render
```

This will generate the HTML version of the book in the `docs/` folder.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup

This book uses shared resources (e.g., images, bibliography files) located in the `_resources/` directory at the project root. To make these accessible from the `en/` and `zh/` subdirectories, we use symbolic links.

### ‚úÖ macOS / Linux

No special setup is required. The symlink is tracked in Git and should work automatically after cloning.

### ü™ü Windows (10 or 11)

1. **Enable Developer Mode** *(only required if you plan to create symlinks)*:
    - Go to **Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí For Developers**
    - Turn on **Developer Mode**

2. **Ensure Git preserves symlinks** when cloning:

    ```bash
    git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/your/repo.git
    ```

    Or configure globally:

    ```bash
    git config --global core.symlinks true
    ```

3. **Verify the symlink** after cloning:

    ```bash
    ls -l en/_resources
    ```

    You should see:

    ```
    _resources -> ../_resources
    ```

    If the symlink appears as a regular file or folder, Quarto builds will fail. In that case, delete and recreate it:

    ```bash
    cd en
    rm -rf _resources
    ln -s ../_resources _resources
    ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Without proper symlink support, image paths, bibliographies, and other shared files may not resolve during `quarto render`.
