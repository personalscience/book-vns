  abstract = {Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory disease characterized by extensive joint tissue inflammation. Implantable bioelectronic devices targeting the inflammatory reflex reduce TNF production and inflammation in preclinical models of inflammatory disease, and in patients with RA and Crohn's disease. Here, we assessed the effect of applying a vibrotactile device to the cymba concha of the external ear on inflammatory responses in healthy subjects, as well as its effect on disease activity in RA patients. Methods: Six healthy subjects received vibrotactile treatment at the cymba concha, and TNF production was analyzed at different time points post-stimulation. In a separate study, nineteen healthy subjects were enrolled in a randomized cross-over study, and effects of vibrotactile treatment at either the cymba concha or gastrocnemius on cytokine levels were assessed. In addition, the clinical efficacy of vibrotactile treatment on disease activity in RA was assessed in nine patients with RA in a prospective interventional study. Results: Vibrotactile treatment at the cymba concha reduced TNF levels, and the suppressive effect persisted up to 24 h. In the cross-over study with 19 healthy subjects, vibrotactile treatment at the cymba concha but not at the gastrocnemius significantly reduced TNF, IL-1{$\beta$}, and IL-6 levels compared to pre-treatment baseline (TNF p {$<$} 0.05, IL-6 p {$<$} 0.01, IL-1{$\beta$} p {$<$} 0.001). In healthy subjects, vibrotactile treatment at the cymba concha inhibited TNF by 80\%, IL-6 by 73\%, and IL-1{$\beta$} by 50\% as compared to pre-treatment baseline levels. In RA patients, a significant decrease in DAS28CRP scores was observed two days post-vibrotactile stimulation at the cymba concha (DAS28-CRP score pre-treatment = 4.19 {\textpm} 0.33 vs post-treatment = 3.12 {\textpm} 0.25, p {$<$} 0.05). Disease activity remained significantly reduced 7 days following vibrotactile treatment (DAS28-CRP score 7 days post-treatment = 2.79 {\textpm} 0.21, p {$<$} 0.01). In addition, a persistent improvement in visual analogue scale scores, a patient derived measure of global health assessment, was observed in RA patients following vibrotactile treatment. Conclusion: Application of a vibrotactile device to the cymba concha inhibits peripheral blood production of TNF, IL1{$\beta$}, and IL-6 in healthy subjects, and attenuates systemic inflammatory responses in RA patients.

  abstract = {Background: The role of autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulation in chronic neck pain remains elusive. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (t-VNS) provides a novel, non-invasive means of potentially mitigating chronic neck pain. This study aimed to assess the effects of ANS modulation on heart rate variability (HRV), pain perception, and neck disability. Methods: In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, 102 participants with chronic neck pain were randomly allocated to one of three groups: t-VNS plus standard-care physiotherapy (SC-PT), heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) with SC-PT, or SC-PT alone. Interventions were administered three times weekly for 6 weeks. The following outcome measures were assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks: HRV, the visual analog scale (VAS), the pressure pain threshold (PPT), and the neck disability index (NDI). Results: The t-VNS group exhibited significant improvements compared to the HRV-BF and SC-PT groups. Specifically, t-VNS increased the RR interval (mean difference [MD] = 35.0 ms; p = 0.037) and decreased the average heart rate (MD = -5.4 bpm; p = 0.039). Additionally, t-VNS reduced the VAS scores (versus HRV-BF: MD = -0.8 cm, p = 0.044; SC-PT: MD = -0.9 cm, p = 0.018), increased the PPT (versus HRV-BF: MD = 94.4 kPa, p {$<$} 0.001; SC-PT (MD = 56.2 kPa, p = 0.001)), and lowered the NDI scores (versus HRV-BF: MD = -4.0, p = 0.015; SC-PT: MD = -5.9, p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions: t-VNS demonstrated superior effectiveness compared to HRV-BF and SC-PT in regulating HRV, alleviating pain, and enhancing functional capabilities in individuals with chronic neck pain.},

This paper aims to discuss electrotechnical and software-based improvements to the state-of-theart stimulators, in order to reduce the experienced side effects of the subjects as well as to increase the efficacy of the stimulation. It was found that side effects such as erythema and pain at the stimulation site are caused by electrolysis at the site of stimulation, which can be reduced by maintaining a voltage below the decomposition voltage. This can be achieved by using electroactive materials and rare-earth fractal metal coatings on the electrode, or by stimulating at the chronaxie with a biphasic rectangular waveform and an in-built short circuit to avoid an after-potential. It is furthermore discussed how the currently most promising stimulation site, the cymba conchae, can technically be stimulated in a feasible and tolerable way for the subject. Utilizing the subjects individual pain threshold is also demonstrated as a good indicator for optimal stimulation, as stimulation just below the pain threshold activates A{$\alpha$} and A{$\beta$}-fibers, while being unable to polarize the smaller diameter A{$\delta$} and C-fibers responsible for pain signaling. Finally, an outlook to individualized tVNS therapy is given, by using evolution algorithms that utilize device and subject data to optimize stimulation parameters.},

  abstract = {Background: Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS) has been shown to be efficacious for the treatment of depression, but to date, VNS devices have required surgical implantation, which has limited widespread implementation. Methods: New noninvasive VNS (nVNS) devices have been developed which allow external stimulation of the vagus nerve, and their effects on physiology in patients with stress-related psychiatric disorders can be measured with brain imaging, blood biomarkers, and wearable sensing devices. Advantages in terms of cost and convenience may lead to more widespread implementation in psychiatry, as well as facilitate research of the physiology of the vagus nerve in humans. nVNS has effects on autonomic tone, cardiovascular function, inflammatory responses, and central brain areas involved in modulation of emotion, all of which make it particularly applicable to patients with stress-related psychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, since dysregulation of these circuits and systems underlies the symptomatology of these disorders. Results: This paper reviewed the physiology of the vagus nerve and its relevance to modulating the stress response in the context of application of nVNS to stress-related psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: nVNS has a favorable effect on stress physiology that is measurable using brain imaging, blood biomarkers of inflammation, and wearable sensing devices, and shows promise in the prevention and treatment of stress-related psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Background: Everyday language relates depressed mood to visual phenomena. Previous studies point to a reduced sensitivity of subjective contrast perception in depressed patients. One way to assess visual contrast perception in an objective way at the level of the retina is to measure the pattern electroretinogram (PERG). To find an objective correlate of reduced contrast perception, we measured the PERG in healthy control subjects and unmedicated and medicated patients with depression. Methods: Forty patients with a diagnosis of major depression (20 with and 20 without medication) and 40 matched healthy subjects were studied. Visual PERGs were recorded from both eyes. Results: Unmedicated and medicated depressed patients displayed dramatically lower retinal contrast gain. We found a strong and significant correlation between contrast gain and severity of depression. This marker distinguishes most patients on a single-case basis from control subjects. A receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed a specificity of 92.5\% and a sensitivity of 77.5\% for classifying the participants correctly. Conclusions: Because PERG recording does not depend on subjective ratings, this marker may be an objective correlate of depression in human beings. If replicated, PERG may be helpful in further animal and human research in depression.},

We examined function and structure of the amygdala and associated areas in a group of unaffected children of depressed parents (at-risk group) and a group of children of parents without a history of major depression (control group). Compared to the control group, the at-risk group showed increased activation to fearful relative to neutral facial expressions in the amygdala and multiple cortical regions, and decreased activation to happy relative to neutral facial expressions in the anterior cingulate cortex and supramarginal gyrus. At-risk children also exhibited reduced amygdala volume. The extensive hyperactivation to negative facial expressions and hypoactivation to positive facial expressions in at-risk children are consistent with behavioral evidence that risk for major depression involves a bias to attend to negative information. These functional and structural brain differences between at-risk children and controls suggest that there are trait neurobiological underpinnings of risk for major depression.},

  abstract = {The retina and brain share similar neurochemistry and neurodevelopmental origins, with the retina, often viewed as a ``window to the brain.'' With retinal measures of structure and function becoming easier to obtain in clinical populations there is a growing interest in using retinal findings as potential biomarkers for disorders affecting the central nervous system. Functional retinal biomarkers, such as the electroretinogram, show promise in neurological disorders, despite having limitations imposed by the existence of overlapping genetic markers, clinical traits or the effects of medications that may reduce their specificity in some conditions. This narrative review summarizes the principal functional retinal findings in central nervous system disorders and related mouse models and provides a background to the main excitatory and inhibitory retinal neurotransmitters that have been implicated to explain the visual electrophysiological findings. These changes in retinal neurochemistry may contribute to our understanding of these conditions based on the findings of retinal electrophysiological tests such as the flash, pattern, multifocal electroretinograms, and electro-oculogram. It is likely that future applications of signal analysis and machine learning algorithms will offer new insights into the pathophysiology, classification, and progression of these clinical disorders including autism, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease. New clinical applications of visual electrophysiology to this field may lead to earlier, more accurate diagnoses and better targeted therapeutic interventions benefiting individual patients and clinicians managing these individuals and their families.},

  abstract = {There are currently no established biomarkers for predicting the therapeutic effectiveness of Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS). Given that neural desynchronization is a pivotal mechanism underlying VNS action, EEG synchronization measures could potentially serve as predictive biomarkers of VNS response. Notably, an increased brain synchronization in delta band has been observed during sleep--potentially due to an activation of thalamocortical circuitry, and interictal epileptiform discharges are more frequently observed during sleep. Therefore, investigation of EEG synchronization metrics during sleep could provide a valuable insight into the excitatory-inhibitory balance in a pro-epileptogenic state, that could be pathological in patients exhibiting a poor response to VNS. A 19-channel-standard EEG system was used to collect data from 38 individuals with Drug-Resistant Epilepsy (DRE) who were candidates for VNS implantation. An EEG synchronization metric--the Weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI)---was extracted before VNS implantation and compared between sleep and wakefulness, and between responders (R) and non-responders (NR). In the delta band, a higher wPLI was found during wakefulness compared to sleep in NR only. However, in this band, no synchronization difference in any state was found between R and NR. During sleep and within the alpha band, a negative correlation was found between wPLI and the percentage of seizure reduction after VNS implantation. Overall, our results suggest that patients exhibiting a poor VNS efficacy may present a more pathological thalamocortical circuitry before VNS implantation. EEG synchronization measures could provide interesting insights into the prerequisites for responding to VNS, in order to avoid unnecessary implantations in patients showing a poor therapeutic efficacy.},

  abstract = {Objective: Major depression disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent mental disorders worldwide. Diagnosing depression in the early stage is crucial to treatment process. However, due to depression's comorbid nature and the subjectivity in diagnosis, an early diagnosis could be challenging. Recently, machine learning approaches have been used to process Electroencephalography (EEG) and neuroimaging data to facilitate the diagnosis. In the present study, we used a multimodal machine learning approach involving EEG, eye tracking and galvanic skin response data as input to classify depression patients and healthy controls. Methods: One hundred and forty-four MDD depression patients and 204 matched healthy controls were recruited. They were required to watch a series of affective and neutral stimuli while EEG, eye tracking information and galvanic skin response were recorded via a set of low-cost, portable devices. Three machine learning algorithms including Random Forests, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were trained to build dichotomous classification model. Results: The results showed that the highest classification f1 score was obtained by Logistic Regression algorithms, with accuracy = 79.63\%, precision = 76.67\%, recall = 85.19\% and f1 score = 80.70\% Limitations: No hospitalized patients were available; only outpatients were included in the present study. The sample consisted mostly of young adult, and no elder patients were included. Conclusions: The machine learning approach can be a useful tool for classifying MDD patients and healthy controls and may help for diagnostic processes.},

Methods: 60 healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 45 were randomly divided into two groups to receive a single session of taVNS and deep breathing exercises. Acute measurements of pulse, blood pressure, perceived stress scale, autonomic activity, and muscle properties were performed before and after the application. Results: A significant decrease was detected in the findings regarding the perceived stress scale, pulse, and blood pressure values as a result of a single session application in both groups (p {$<$} 0.05). In addition, it was determined that the findings regarding autonomic measurement values increased in favor of the parasympathetic nervous system in both groups (p {$<$} 0.05). In measurements of the structural properties of the muscle, the stiffness values of the muscles examined in both groups decreased (p {$<$} 0.05), while the findings regarding relaxation increased (p {$<$} 0.05), except for the masseter in the deep breathing (DB) group. As a result of the comparative statistical evaluation between the groups, the increase in parasympathetic activity was found to be greater in the DB group according to root mean square of differences in successive RR intervals (RMSSD), the percent of differences in adjacent RR intervals {$>$} 50 ms (pNN50), and stress index parameters (p {$<$} 0.05). In the measurements made with the Myoton{\textregistered}PRO device, the increase in the relaxation value was higher in the gastrocnemius muscle of the VNS group (p {$<$} 0.05). Conclusions: It has been observed that both methods can increase parasympathetic activity and muscle relaxation in healthy people in a single session. However, DB appears to be slightly superior in increasing parasympathetic activity, and VNS appears to be slightly superior in increasing relaxation.},

  abstract = {Objective:               Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an adjunctive and well-established treatment for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). However, it is still difficult to identify patients who may benefit from VNS surgery. Our study aims to propose a VNS outcome prediction model based on machine learning with multidimensional preoperative heart rate variability (HRV) indices.                                         Methods:               The preoperative electrocardiography (ECG) of 59 patients with DRE and of 50 healthy controls were analyzed. Responders were defined as having at least 50\% average monthly seizure frequency reduction at 1-year follow-up. Time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear indices of HRV were compared between 30 responders and 29 non-responders in awake and sleep states, respectively. For feature selection, univariate filter and recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithms were performed to assess the importance of different HRV indices to VNS outcome prediction and improve the classification performance. Random forest (RF) was used to train the classifier, and leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation was performed to evaluate the prediction model.                                         Results:               Among 52 HRV indices, 49 showed significant differences between DRE patients and healthy controls. In sleep state, 35 HRV indices of responders were significantly higher than those of non-responders, while 16 of them showed the same differences in awake state. Low-frequency power (LF) ranked first in the importance ranking results by univariate filter and RFE methods, respectively. With HRV indices in sleep state, our model achieved 74.6\% accuracy, 80\% precision, 70.6\% recall, and 75\% F1 for VNS outcome prediction, which was better than the optimal performance in awake state (65.3\% accuracy, 66.4\% precision, 70.5\% recall, and 68.4\% F1).                                         Significance:               With the ECG during sleep state and machine learning techniques, the statistical model based on preoperative HRV could achieve a better performance of VNS outcome prediction and, therefore, help patients who are not suitable for VNS to avoid the high cost of surgery and possible risks of long-term stimulation.},

  abstract = {Given its non-invasive nature, there is increasing interest in the use of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) across basic, translational and clinical research. Contemporaneously, tVNS can be achieved by stimulating either the auricular branch or the cervical bundle of the vagus nerve, referred to as transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation(VNS) and transcutaneous cervical VNS, respectively. In order to advance the field in a systematic manner, studies using these technologies need to adequately report sufficient methodological detail to enable comparison of results between studies, replication of studies, as well as enhancing study participant safety. We systematically reviewed the existing tVNS literature to evaluate current reporting practices. Based on this review, and consensus among participating authors, we propose a set of minimal reporting items to guide future tVNS studies. The suggested items address specific technical aspects of the device and stimulation parameters. We also cover general recommendations including inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, outcome parameters and the detailed reporting of side effects. Furthermore, we review strategies used to identify the optimal stimulation parameters for a given research setting and summarize ongoing developments in animal research with potential implications for the application of tVNS in humans. Finally, we discuss the potential of tVNS in future research as well as the associated challenges across several disciplines in research and clinical practice.},

The noradrenergic center locus coeruleus (LC) is vital for VNS effects; however, the impact of varying stimulation parameters on LC activation is poorly understood. This study characterized LC activation across VNS parameters. Extracellular activity was recorded in rats' left LC while 11 VNS paradigms, utilizing variable frequencies and bursting characteristics, were pseudorandomly delivered to the left cervical vagus for five cycles. Neurons' change from baseline firing rate and timing response profiles were assessed. The proportion of neurons categorized as responders over 5 VNS cycles doubled in comparison to the first VNS cycle (p {$<$} 0.001) for all VNS paradigms, demonstrating an amplification effect. The percentage of positively consistent/positive responders increased for standard VNS paradigms with frequencies t10 Hz and for bursting paradigms with shorter interburst intervals and more pulses per burst. The synchrony between pairs of LC neurons increased during bursting VNS but not standard paradigms. Also, the probability of evoking a direct response during bursting VNS was higher with longer interburst intervals and a higher number of pulses per burst. Standard paradigms between 10--30 Hz best positively activates LC with consistency to VNS while the best bursting paradigm to increase activity was 300 Hz, seven pulses per burst separated by 1 s. Bursting VNS was effective in increasing synchrony between pairs of neurons, suggesting a common network recruitment originating from vagal afferents. These results indicate differential activation of LC neurons depending on the VNS parameters delivered.},

  abstract = {Background: Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) stimulating the auricular branch of the vagus nerve along a well-defined neuroanatomical pathway, has promising therapeutic efficacy. Potentially, taVNS can modulate autonomic responses. Specifically, taVNS can induce more consistent parasympathetic activation and may lead to increased heart rate variability (HRV). However, the effects of taVNS on HRV remain inconclusive. Here, we investigated changes in HRV due to brief alteration periods of parasympathetic-vagal cardiac activity produced by taVNS on the cymba as opposed to control administration via the helix. Materials and Methods: We compared the effect of 10 min of active stimulation (i.e., cymba conchae) to sham stimulation (i.e., helix) on peripheral cardiovascular response, in 28 healthy young adults. HRV was estimated in the time domain and frequency domain during the overall stimulation. Results: Although active-taVNS and sham-taVNS stimulation did not differ in subjective intensity ratings, the active stimulation of the cymba led to vagally mediated HRV increases in both the time and frequency domains. Differences were significant between active-taVNS and both sham-taVNS and resting conditions in the absence of stimulation for various HRV parameters, but not for the lowfrequency index of HRV, where no differences were found between active-taVNS and sham-taVNS conditions. Conclusion: This work supports the hypothesis that taVNS reliably induces a rapid increase in HRV parameters when auricular stimulation is used to recruit fibers in the cymba compared to stimulation at another site. The results suggest that HRV can be used as a physiological indicator of autonomic tone in taVNS for research and potential therapeutic applications, in line with the established effects of invasive VNS. Knowledge of the physiological effect of taVNS short sessions in modulating cardiovagal processing is essential for enhancing its clinical use.},

  abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of the fluctuations in the intervals between consecutive heartbeats, is an indicator of changes in the autonomic nervous system. A chronic reduction in HRV has been repeatedly linked to clinical depression. However, the chronological and mechanistic aspects of this relationship, between the neural, physiological, and psychopathological levels, remain unclear. In this review we present evidence by which changes in HRV might precede the onset of depression. We describe several pathways that can facilitate this relationship. First, we examine a theoretical model of the impact of autonomic imbalance on HRV and its role in contributing to mood dysregulation and depression. We then highlight brain regions that are regulating both HRV and emotion, suggesting these neural regions, and the Insula in particular, as potential mediators of this relationship. We also present additional possible mediating mechanisms involving the immune system and inflammation processes. Lastly, we support this model by showing evidence that modification of HRV with biofeedback leads to an improvement in some symptoms of depression. The possibility that changes in HRV precede the onset of depression is critical to put to the test, not only because it could provide insights into the mechanisms of the illness but also because it may offer a predictive and diagnostic physiological marker for depression. Importantly, it could also help to develop new effective clinical interventions for treating depression. {\'O} 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of IBRO.

  abstract = {Introduction: Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is used as an alternative treatment in drug-resistant epilepsy patients. Effects of VNS on the cardiac autonomic system are controversial. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between VNS parameters and heart rate variability (HRV) in epilepsy patients who underwent VNS treatment. Methods: Our study included 31 patients who underwent VNS for drug-resistant epilepsy. Patients were divided into groups according to response to VNS and VNS parameters. All patients underwent 24-h Holter ECG. Results: The mean age of 31 VNS-treated epilepsy patients included in the study was 33.87 {\textpm} 7.6 years. When patients were grouped according to VNS response, 25 patients were in the VNS responder group and six patients were in the VNSnonresponder group. When comparing Holter parameters in the VNS responder and non-responder groups, the median HF was significantly lower in the VNS responder group. VNS duration and signal frequency had a positive effect on LF/HF, while output and off time had a negative effect on LF/HF. When ROC analysis was performed to determine the cut-off values of the parameters for the VNS-responsive state, the AUC value of the HF parameter was 0.780, which was statistically significant. The cut-off value to distinguish response to VNS was 156.9. Conclusion: In conclusion, the effects of VNS parameters on HRV parameters are quite complex. However, the conclusion is that VNS is a neuromodulation method that affects the autonomic system in a complex way. Different levels of VNS parameters may also contribute to this effect. Furthermore, HRV parameters can be used as biomarkers to predict the patient population that may benefit from VNS.},

  abstract = {Background: Depression is a severe disease with great burdens for the affected individuals and public health care systems. Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction indexed by measures of heart rate variability (HRV) has repeatedly been associated with depression. However, HRV parameters are subject to a wide range of multi-factorial influences and underlying mechanisms in depression are still unclear. HRV parameters have been proposed to be promising candidates for diagnostic or predictive bio-markers for depression but necessary longitudinal design studies investigating the relationship between HRV and depression are scarce. Methods: The sample in this study consisted of 62 depressive individuals without antidepressant medication prior to assessment and 65 healthy controls. Fifteen minute blocks of resting ECGs were recorded 1--2 days before onset of antidepressant treatment and 2 weeks thereafter. The ECGs were pre-processed to extract inter-beat-intervals. Linear and non-linear methods were used to extract HRV parameters. ANOVAS were performed to investigate group differences between depressive patients and healthy controls. Associations between the change in severity of depression and HRV parameters were assessed in a repeated measurements design. Results: Analyses revealed HRV parameter differences between the groups of depressive patients and healthy controls at baseline. Further results show differences in HRV parameters within subjects after 2 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Change in HRV parameter values correlated with changes in symptom severity of depression. Discussion: The current results provide further insight into the relationship between HRV parameters and depression. This may help to underpin utilization of HRV parameters are bio-maker for disease state in depression. Results are discussed within a theoretical framework to link arousal and ANS regulation in depression.},

In this study, the effect of transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) and DB on vagal tone was compared in healthy participants and RA or SLE patients. The vagal tone was estimated using time-domain heart-rate variability (HRV) parameters. Forty-two healthy participants and 52 patients performed 30 min of DB and 30 min of taVNS on separate days. HRV was recorded before and immediately after each intervention. For the healthy participants, all HRV parameters increased after DB (SDNN + RMSSD: 21--46\%), while one HRV parameter increased after taVNS (SDNN: 16\%). For the patients, all HRV parameters increased after both DB (17--31\%) and taVNS (18--25\%), with no differences between the two types of VNS. DB was associated with the largest elevation of the HRV parameters in healthy participants, while both types of VNS led to elevated HRV parameters in the patients. The findings support a potential use of VNS as a new treatment approach, but the clinical effects need to be investigated in future studies.},

Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (ta-VNS) may be an effective treatment option for insomnia. This study aims to evaluate the effect and safety of ta-VNS and compare it with transcutaneous nonvagus nerve stimulation (tn-VNS). A multicenter, randomized, clinical trial was conducted at 3 hospitals in China enrolling 72 insomnia participants from May 2016 to June 2017. Participants were randomly assigned (1\,:\,1) to receive 40 sessions of ta-VNS or tn-VNS treatment. 63 participants completed the trial. ta-VNS treatment significantly decreased the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, Flinders Fatigue Scale score, Hamilton Depression Scale score, and Hamilton Anxiety Scale score over 4 weeks compared with those of the baseline. Moreover, it also significantly increased the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey Questionnaire scores compared with that of the baseline. However, it did not show significant differences compared with tn-VNS in changes of primary and secondary outcomes. The incidence of adverse events was low. ta-VNS significantly relieved insomnia over 4 weeks. Moreover, it also alleviated fatigue and improved participants' quality of life as well as other concomitant symptoms such as depression and anxiety.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose This study aimed to determine the long-term effects of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), daytime sleepiness, and sleep quality in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). It also investigated the relationships among these main effects, clinical characteristics, and VNS parameters. Methods Twenty-four patients were recruited. Paired t-tests and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine how the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients influenced the variables that changed significantly after VNS treatment. Results After VNS, the patients showed significant increases in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), respiratory disturbance index (RDI), apnea index, hypopnea index, and oxygen desaturation index (ODI), as well as a significant decrease in the lowest arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2 nadir) (p{$<$}0.05). The multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated that the predictor of larger increases in AHI and RDI was being older at baseline, and that the predictor of a larger increase in apnea index was a longer epilepsy duration. The strongest predictor of a larger increase in ODI was a higher frequency of aura episodes at baseline, followed by a longer epilepsy duration. The strongest predictor of a larger decrease in SaO2 nadir was a higher frequency of aura episodes at baseline, followed by a longer epilepsy duration. Conclusions This study has confirmed that VNS improves seizure control in patients with DRE, whereas it increases obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Furthermore, the increase in OSA is affected by age and the duration of epilepsy. Therefore, careful observation and monitoring of SDB is recommended in patients who undergo VNS.},

  abstract = {Background. Major depression (MD) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been observed in MD. Given the predictive value of HRV for cardiovascular health, reduced HRV might be one physiological factor that mediates this association. Methods. The purpose of this study was to provide up-to-date random-effects meta-analyses of studies which compare resting-state measures of HRV between unmedicated adults with MD and controls. Database search considered English and German literature to July 2018. Results. A total of 21 studies including 2250 patients and 1982 controls were extracted. Significant differences between patients and controls were found for (i) frequency domains such as HF-HRV [Hedges' g = -0.318; 95\% CI (-0.388 to -0.247)], LF-HRV (Hedges' g = -0.195; 95\% CI (-0.332 to -0.059)], LF/HF-HRV (Hedges' g = 0.195; 95\% CI (0.086--0.303)] and VLF-HRV (Hedges' g = -0.096; 95\% CI (-0.179 to -0.013)), and for (ii) time-domains such as IBI (Hedges' g = -0.163; 95\% CI (-0.304 to -0.022)], RMSSD (Hedges' g = -0.462; 95\% CI (-0.612 to -0.312)] and SDNN (Hedges' g = -0.266; 95\% CI (-0.431 to -0.100)]. Conclusions. Our findings demonstrate that all HRV-measures were lower in MD than in healthy controls and thus strengthens evidence for lower HRV as a potential cardiovascular risk factor in these patients.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS), an open-access online stimulus set containing 900 color images depicting a broad spectrum of themes, including humans, animals, objects, and scenes, along with normative ratings on two affective dimensions---valence (i.e., the degree of positive or negative affective response that the image evokes) and arousal (i.e., the intensity of the affective response that the image evokes). The OASIS images were collected from online sources, and valence and arousal ratings were obtained in an online study (total N = 822). The valence and arousal ratings covered much of the circumplex space and were highly reliable and consistent across gender groups. OASIS has four advantages: (a) the stimulus set contains a large number of images in four categories; (b) the data were collected in 2015, and thus OASIS features more current images and reflects more current ratings of valence and arousal than do existing stimulus sets; (c) the OASIS database affords users the ability to interactively explore images by category and ratings; and, most critically, (d) OASIS allows for free use of the images in online and offline research studies, as they are not subject to the copyright restrictions that apply to the International Affective Picture System. The OASIS images, along with normative valence and arousal ratings, are available for download from www.benedekkurdi.com/\#oasis or https://db.tt/yYTZYCga.},

  abstract = {The most critical burden for People with Epilepsy (PwE) is represented by seizures, the unpredictability of which severely impacts quality of life. The design of real-time warning systems that can detect or even predict ictal events would enhance seizure management, leading to high benefits for PwE and their caregivers. In the past, various research works highlighted that seizure onset is anticipated by significant changes in autonomic cardiac control, which can be assessed through heart rate variability (HRV). This manuscript conducted a scoping review of the literature analyzing HRV-based methods for detecting or predicting ictal events. An initial search on the PubMed database returned 402 papers, 72 of which met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. These results suggest that seizure detection is more accurate in neonatal and pediatric patients due to more significant autonomic modifications during the ictal transitions. In addition, conventional metrics are often incapable of capturing cardiac autonomic variations and should be replaced with more advanced methodologies, considering non-linear HRV features and machine learning tools for processing them. Finally, studies investigating wearable systems for heart monitoring denoted how HRV constitutes an efficient biomarker for seizure detection in patients presenting significant alterations in autonomic cardiac control during ictal events.},

  abstract = {The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased demand for mental health interventions, with a special focus on digitally assisted ones. Self-regulation describes a set of meta-skills that enable one to take control over his/her mental health and it is recognized as a vital indicator of well-being. Mindfulness training is a promising training strategy for promoting self-regulation, behavioral change, and mental well-being. A growing body of research outlines that smart technologies are ready to revolutionize the way mental health training programs take place. Artificial intelligence (AI); extended reality (XR) including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR); as well as the advancements in brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are ready to transform these mental health training programs. Mindfulness-based interventions assisted by smart technologies for mental, emotional, and behavioral regulation seem to be a crucial yet under-investigated issue. The current systematic review paper aims to explore whether and how smart technologies can assist mindfulness training for the development of self-regulation skills among people at risk of mental health issues as well as populations with various clinical characteristics. The PRISMA 2020 methodology was utilized to respond to the objectives and research questions using a total of sixty-six experimental studies that met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that digitally assisted mindfulness interventions supported by smart technologies, including AI-based applications, chatbots, virtual coaches, immersive technologies, and brain-sensing headbands, can effectively assist trainees in developing a wide range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral self-regulation skills, leading to a greater satisfaction of their psychological needs, and thus mental wellness. These results may provide positive feedback for developing smarter and more inclusive training environments, with a special focus on people with special training needs or disabilities.},

  abstract = {Background: Electroretinograms (ERG) are usually recorded with noninvasive corneal electrodes, requiring direct contact with the ocular surface. However, corneal electrode application is not tolerated by some individuals. The advent of handheld ERG devices has facilitated the use of skin electrodes for ERG measurements. Skin electrodes do not require corneal contact and thus enhance patient comfort, simplify the attachment process, and reduce preparation time, which is particularly beneficial for clinical psychiatric research. Nevertheless, due to the different attachment methods, ERG amplitudes recorded with skin compared to corneal electrodes are considerably smaller. However, comparative data on ERGs recorded with skin vs. corneal electrodes in psychiatric populations are currently lacking. Materials and methods: We recorded flash electroretinograms of 57 healthy controls (HC) and 30 patients with a major depressive disorder (MDD) using both {\textregistered} sensor strip skin and corneal electrodes with the handheld RETeval device. Results: The significant reduction in both the amplitude and peak time of the a-wave in MDD when using sensor strip skin electrodes could not be replicated with corneal electrodes. Comparing both electrode types in HC revealed a fair correlation between sensor strip and corneal electrodes for a- and b-wave amplitudes and a moderate correlation for a- and b-wave peak times. Conclusion: In addition to being better tolerated, sensor strip skin electrodes appear to be more effective than corneal electrodes in detecting ERG alterations {\textregistered} in patients with MDD when using the RETeval device, making them a promising alternative to traditional corneal electrodes.},

This study aimed to validate HRV measurements obtained from Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 against the Polar H10 chest strap paired with the Kubios HRV software, which together served as the reference standard. A prospective cohort of 39 healthy adults provided 316 HRV measurements over a 14-day period. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to assess the difference in HRV between devices, accounting for repeated measures. Apple Watch tended to underestimate HRV by an average of 8.31 ms compared to the Polar H10 (p = 0.025), with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 28.88\% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 20.46 ms. The study found no significant impact of RHR discrepancies on HRV differences (p = 0.156), with RHR showing a mean difference of -0.08 bpm, an MAPE of 5.91\%, and an MAE of 3.73 bpm. Equivalence testing indicated that the HRV measurements from Apple Watch did not fall within the pre-specified equivalence margin of {\textpm}10 ms. Despite accurate RHR measurements, these findings underscore the need for improved HRV algorithms in consumer wearables and caution in interpreting HRV data for clinical or performance monitoring.},

  abstract = {Background: Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has emerged as a promising technique to modulate autonomic functions, and pupil dilation has been recognized as a promising biomarker for tVNS-induced monoaminergic release. Nevertheless, studies on the effectiveness of various tVNS protocols have produced heterogeneous results on pupil dilation to date. Methods: Here, we synthesize the existing evidence and compare conventional (``continuous'') and pulsed stim\- ulation protocols using a Bayesian meta-analysis. To maintain a living version, we developed a Shiny App with the possibility to incorporate newly published studies in the future. Based on a systematic review, we included 18 studies (N = 771) applying either conventional or pulsed stimulation protocols. Results: Across studies, we found anecdotal evidence for the null hypothesis, showing that taVNS does not in\- crease pupil size (g = 0.15, 95 \% CI = [0.03, 0.27], BF01 = 1.0). Separating studies according to conventional vs. pulsed protocols revealed that studies using pulsed taVNS provide strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis (g = 0.36, 95 \% CI = [0.19, 0.53], BF10 = 50.8) while conventional taVNS studies provide strong evidence for the null hypothesis (g = 0.002, CI = [-0.14, 0.14], BF01 = 21.9). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis highlights differential effects of conventional and pulsed taVNS protocols on pupil dilation. These findings underscore the relevance of taVNS protocols in optimizing its use for specific applications that may require modulation of tonic vs. phasic monoaminergic responses and might also help to gain mecha\- nistic insights into potential therapeutic effects.},

However, its safety and tolerability profile is unclear. Objective: We performed a systematic review of treatment harms from tVNS in humans. Methods: A systematic published and grey literature search was carried out to identify studies which deployed tVNS in human subjects. Study authors were contacted for safety/tolerability data if these were not available in the publication. Databases were searched from 1966 to May 2017. We noted study type, population, stimulation parameters, type and prevalence of side effects and/or serious adverse events (SAE). We also noted whether side effects/SAE were considered to be related to the tVNS and the proportion of participants dropping out of studies due to side effects. Results: 51 studies were included comprising a total of 1322 human subjects receiving tVNS. The most common side effects were: local skin irritation from electrode placement (240 participants, 18.2\%), headache (47, 3.6\%) and nasopharyngitis (23, 1.7\%). Whilst heterogeneity in overall side effect event rates between studies was not accounted for by the frequency (Hz) or pulse width (ms) of stimulation, a minority (35 participants (2.6\%)) dropped out of studies due to side effects. Overall, 30 SAE occurred but only 3 were assessed by the relevant researchers to be possibly caused by tVNS. Conclusion: tVNS is safe and well tolerated at the doses tested in research studies to date. {\copyright} 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been tested as therapy for several brain disorders and as a means to modulate cortical excitability and brain plasticity. Cortical effects of VNS, manifesting as vagal-evoked potentials (VEPs), are thought to arise from activation of ascending cholinergic and noradrenergic systems. However, it is unknown whether those effects are modulated by brain state at the time of stimulation. In 2 freely behaving macaque monkeys, we delivered short trains of 5 pulses to the left cervical vagus nerve at different frequencies (5-300 Hz) while recording local field potentials (LFPs) from sites in contralateral prefrontal, sensorimotor and parietal cortical areas. Brain states were inferred from spectral components of LFPs and the presence of overt movement: active awake, resting awake, REM sleep and NREM sleep. VNS elicited VEPs in all sampled cortical areas. VEPs comprised early ({$<$}70 ms), intermediate (70-250 ms) and late ({$>$}250 ms) components. The magnitude of the intermediate and late components was largest during NREM sleep and smallest during wakefulness, whereas that of the early component was not modulated by brain state. VEPs during NREM were larger for stimuli delivered at the depolarized phase of ongoing delta oscillations. Higher pulsing frequencies generated larger VEPs. These short VNS trains did not affect brain state transitions during wakefulness or sleep. Our findings suggest that ongoing brain state modulates the evoked effects of VNS on cortical activity. This has implications for the role of ongoing cortical activity and brain state in shaping cortical responses to peripheral stimuli, for the modulation of vagal interoceptive signaling by cortical activity, and for the dose calibration of VNS therapies.},

  abstract = {Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is widely used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy and depression. While the precise mechanisms mediating its long-term therapeutic effects are not fully resolved, they likely involve locus coeruleus (LC) stimulation via the nucleus of the solitary tract, which receives afferent vagal inputs. In rats, VNS elevates LC firing and forebrain noradrenaline levels, whereas LC lesions suppress VNS therapeutic efficacy. Noninvasive transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) uses electrical stimulation that targets the auricular branch of the vagus nerve at the cymba conchae of the ear. However, the extent to which tVNS mimics VNS remains unclear. Here, we investigated the short-term effects of tVNS in healthy human male volunteers (               n               = 24), using high-density EEG and pupillometry during visual fixation at rest. We compared short (3.4 s) trials of tVNS to sham electrical stimulation at the earlobe (far from the vagus nerve branch) to control for somatosensory stimulation. Although tVNS and sham stimulation did not differ in subjective intensity ratings, tVNS led to robust pupil dilation (peaking 4--5 s after trial onset) that was significantly higher than following sham stimulation. We further quantified, using parallel factor analysis, how tVNS modulates idle occipital alpha (8--13Hz) activity identified in each participant. We found greater attenuation of alpha oscillations by tVNS than by sham stimulation. This demonstrates that tVNS reliably induces pupillary and EEG markers of arousal beyond the effects of somatosensory stimulation, thus supporting the hypothesis that tVNS elevates noradrenaline and other arousal-promoting neuromodulatory signaling, and mimics invasive VNS.                                         SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               Current noninvasive brain stimulation techniques are mostly confined to modulating cortical activity, as is typical with transcranial magnetic or transcranial direct/alternating current electrical stimulation. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has been proposed to stimulate subcortical arousal-promoting nuclei, though previous studies yielded inconsistent results. Here we show that short (3.4 s) tVNS pulses in naive healthy male volunteers induced transient pupil dilation and attenuation of occipital alpha oscillations. These markers of brain arousal are in line with the established effects of invasive VNS on locus coeruleus--noradrenaline signaling, and support that tVNS mimics VNS. Therefore, tVNS can be used as a tool for studying how endogenous subcortical neuromodulatory signaling affects human cognition, including perception, attention, memory, and decision-making; and also for developing novel clinical applications.},

Chatbots based on generative artificial intelligence (AI), like ChatGPT, are emerging as novel solutions, but research on real-life usage is limited. We interviewed nineteen individuals about their experiences using generative AI chatbots for mental health. Participants reported high engagement and positive impacts, including better relationships and healing from trauma and loss. We developed four themes: (1) a sense of `               emotional sanctuary'               , (2) `               insightful guidance'               , particularly about relationships, (3) the `               joy of connection               ', and (4) comparisons between the `               AI therapist               ' and human therapy. Some themes echoed prior research on rule-based chatbots, while others seemed novel to generative AI. Participants emphasised the need for better safety guardrails, human-like memory and the ability to lead the therapeutic process. Generative AI chatbots may offer mental health support that feels meaningful to users, but further research is needed on safety and effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Background: The autonomic response to transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has been linked to the engagement of brainstem circuitry modulating autonomic outflow. However, the physiological mechanisms supporting such efferent vagal responses are not well understood, particularly in humans. Hypothesis: We present a paradigm for estimating directional brain-heart interactions in response to taVNS. We propose that our approach is able to identify causal links between the activity of brainstem nuclei involved in autonomic control and cardiovagal outflow. Methods: We adopt an approach based on a recent reformulation of Granger causality that includes permutation-based, nonparametric statistics. The method is applied to ultrahigh field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected on healthy subjects during taVNS. Results: Our framework identified taVNS-evoked functional brainstem responses with superior sensitivity compared to prior conventional approaches, confirming causal links between taVNS stimulation and fMRI response in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). Furthermore, our causal approach elucidated potential mechanisms by which information is relayed between brainstem nuclei and cardiovagal, i.e., high-frequency heart rate variability, in response to taVNS. Our findings revealed that key brainstem nuclei, known from animal models to be involved in cardiovascular control, exert a causal influence on taVNS-induced cardiovagal outflow in humans. Conclusion: Our causal approach allowed us to noninvasively evaluate directional interactions between fMRI BOLD signals from brainstem nuclei and cardiovagal outflow.},

The review focuses on the impact of VNS on emotional processing, executive functions, learning, memory, and its clinical applications in conditions such as epilepsy, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurological disorders. Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) was conducted using the keywords ``vagus nerve stimulation,'' ``cognitive enhancement,'' ``emotional processing,'' ``executive function,'' ``learning and memory,'' ``epilepsy,'' ``depression,'' ``Alzheimer's disease,'' ``neurological disorders,'' ``attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,'' ``sleep disorders,'' and ``long COVID.'' The inclusion criteria encompassed controlled trials, longitudinal studies, and meta-analyses published in English between 2000 and July 2024. Results: A comprehensive review of 100 articles highlighted the cognitive effects of Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS). Studies show that VNS, especially through transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS), enhances emotional recognition, particularly for facial expressions, and improves selective attention under high cognitive demands. Additionally, VNS enhances learning and memory, including associative memory and spatial working memory tasks. In clinical applications, VNS exhibits promising benefits for improving cognitive functions in treatment-resistant epilepsy, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. Conclusion: VNS represents a promising therapeutic approach for enhancing cognitive function across diverse patient populations. The reviewed evidence highlights its efficacy in modulating cognitive domains in healthy individuals and improving cognition in neurological conditions. However, the comparative effectiveness of different VNS modalities and the differential effects of online versus offline VNS on cognitive psychology require further investigation.

This is a fully remote, multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized superiority trial of 10-week home-based tDCS in MDD. Participants were 18 years or older, with MDD in current depressive episode of at least moderate severity as measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (mean\,=\,19.07\,{\textpm}\,2.73). A total of 174 participants (120 women, 54 men) were randomized to active (               n               \,=\,87, mean age\,=\,37.09\,{\textpm}\,11.14 years) or sham (               n               \,=\,87, mean age\,=\,38.32\,{\textpm}\,10.92 years) treatment. tDCS consisted of five sessions per week for 3 weeks then three sessions per week for 7 weeks in a 10-week trial, followed by a 10-week open-label phase. Each session lasted 30\,min; the anode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the cathode over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (active tDCS 2\,mA and sham tDCS 0\,mA, with brief ramp up and down to mimic active stimulation). As the primary outcome, depressive symptoms showed significant improvement when measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale: active 9.41\,{\textpm}\,6.25 point improvement (10-week mean\,=\,9.58\,{\textpm}\,6.02) and sham 7.14\,{\textpm}\,6.10 point improvement (10-week mean\,=\,11.66\,{\textpm}\,5.96) (95\% confidence interval\,=\,0.51--4.01,               P               \,=\,0.012). There were no differences in discontinuation rates. In summary, a 10-week home-based tDCS treatment with remote supervision in MDD showed high efficacy, acceptability and safety.

  abstract = {Objective: Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) for treating mild to moderate depression in patients with epilepsy (PWE). Methods: A single-arm, prospective, multi-center, pre-post controlled study was conducted in Eastern China. After a four-week baseline period, PWE with mild to moderate depression began treatment with taVNS, administered for 30 min, three times daily, over a 12-week period. The primary outcome measure was the change in 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores from baseline to week 12. Secondary outcomes included the response and remission rates for depression at week 12, as well as changes in the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31 (QOLIE-31) scores, and seizure frequency at weeks 4 and 12 compared to baseline. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded to assess the safety of taVNS. Both modified Intention-To-Treat (mITT) and Per-Protocol (PP) analyses were employed. Results: Sixty-nine participants were enrolled in this study. Of these, 61 (88.4 \%) completed the 4-week treatment phase, and 50 (72.5 \%) finished the 12-week treatment phase. In the mITT analysis, HAMD scores significantly decreased by 4.54 {\textpm} 7.44 (p {$<$} 0.001) from baseline to week 12, with clinical response in 16 (26.2 \%) and remission in 15 (24.6 \%) patients. HAMA scores also decreased significantly by week 4 (3.23 {\textpm} 5.18, p {$<$} 0.001) and week 12 (4.95 {\textpm} 6.78, p {$<$} 0.001). PSQI scores and seizure frequency showed non-significant changes at week 4, but seizure frequency decreased significantly by week 12 (0.03 {\textpm} 10.47, p = 0.038). In the PP analysis, similar improvements were observed. After 12 weeks of taVNS compared to baseline, HAMD scores decreased significantly by 5.32 {\textpm} 8.98 (p {$<$} 0.001), with 32 \% of patients achieving a clinical response and 24 \% achieving clinical remission. And HAMA scores also decreased by 5.66 {\textpm} 7.54 (p {$<$} 0.001), seizure frequency by 0.14 {\textpm} 11.03 (p = 0.018), and PSQI scores by 1.06 {\textpm} 4.14 (p = 0.076).There was a significant increase in QOLIE-31 scores by 5.17 {\textpm} 14.71 (p = 0.020). Ten (14.5 \%) patients experienced non-serious adverse events, the most common of which was ear pain (n = 4); one patient withdrew due to tinnitus enhancement; all resolved after reducing the stimulation intensity or stopping the treatment. Conclusion: Our study suggests that taVNS may effectively improve depressive symptoms in PWE. This may be an efficacious and safe treatment for mild to moderate depression in PWE.},

  abstract = {Objective/Hypothesis: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an established therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy, depression, and a number of other disorders. Transcutaneous stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (tVNS) has been considered as a non-invasive alternative. Several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on the effects of tVNS used different stimulation parameters and locations in the ear, which makes it difficult to determine the optimal tVNS methodology. The present study used fMRI to determine the most effective location for tVNS. Materials and Methods: Four stimulation locations in the ear were compared: the inner tragus, inferoposterior wall of the ear canal, cymba conchae, and earlobe (sham). Thirty-seven healthy subjects underwent two 6-min tVNS stimulation runs per electrode location (monophasic rectangular 500 ls pulses, 25 Hz). General linear model was performed using SPM; region-of-interest analyses were performed for the brainstem areas. Results: Stimulation at the ear canal resulted in the weakest activation of the nucleus of solitary tract (NTS), the recipient of most afferent vagal projections, and of the locus coeruleus (LC), a brainstem nucleus that receives direct input from the NTS. Stimulation of the inner tragus and cymba conchae activated these two nuclei as compared to sham. However, ROI analysis showed that only stimulation of the cymba conchae produced a significantly stronger activation in both the NTS and LC than did the sham stimulation. Conclusions: These findings suggest that tVNS at the cymba conchae properly activates the vagal pathway and results in its strongest activation, and thus may be the optimal location for tVNS therapies applied to the auricle.},

  abstract = {As a representative of acupuncture and nonpharmaceutical therapy, auricular acupuncture has been widely for the treatment of insomnia. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a combination of auricular point stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation. It can not only treat primary insomnia effectively, but also is noninvasive, painless, portable and economical. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a core region of default mode network (DMN), which is important for maintenance of sleep. However, the mechanism of taVNS in alleviating primary insomnia (PI) remains to be clarified. In this study, we found that taVNS could not only effectively reduce the score of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, but also decreased functional connection (FC) between the left mPFC and bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus as well as FC between the right mPFC and the occipital cortex in patients with PI. Furthermore, the decrease in FC was positively correlated with the decline of sleep index score. Therefore, we proposed that treatment with taVNS can improve sleep quality and prolong sleep duration in patients with PI by reducing FC within DMN, FC between DMN and salience network, as well as FC between DMN and the occipital cortex. This may be one of mechanisms of taVNS in treating PI.},
